Once you launch the Interactive Generative Art Gallery, you can explore and interact with various digital art forms.  
This project integrates generative art, image and audio manipulation, and interactive visualizations** within a web-based platform.  

The following features are implemented in the project:

1. Generative Art with Pygame**  
   This feature allows users to interact with dynamic shapes that move and respond to inputs.

2. Data Visualization with Matplotlib**  
   A 3D visualization of disease cases in Morocco is provided to analyze trends dynamically.

3. Image Manipulation with PIL and OpenCV**  
   Various filters such as grayscale, sepia, inversion, and glitch effects are available.

4. Audio Processing with PyDub**  
   Users can modify audio speed, apply fade effects, reverse tracks, or generate soundscapes.

5. Web Hosting with Flask**  
   The gallery provides an intuitive interface allowing users to upload images, process them, and view results interactively.

6. Style Transfer with PyTorch**  
   A deep learning-based style transfer feature is included to transform images artistically.

### Important Notes  
- Integration of Pygame with Flask required executing Pygame scripts independently and redirecting users accordingly.  
- Performance Optimization was applied to improve rendering speed for complex 3D plots.  
- Image and Audio Compatibility required preprocessing steps to handle different formats efficiently.  
- Scalability Considerations include potential cloud integration and Docker containerization for future expansions.
